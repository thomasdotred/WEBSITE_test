# Good Morning Sgt. Coder Thomas
I hope you are having a good snooze in on your birthday soldier. Here is your present, your very own domain [thomas.red](https://thomas.red/) and email (toby@thomas.red) -> password is being sent via private communications.

I have set up the barebones for your very own online CV, to display all those cool AI codeblocks and projects you are working on. To get started open up your terminal and 'git clone' this repo. Then visit [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) and get building!

Happy coding,

your pal Tobias
